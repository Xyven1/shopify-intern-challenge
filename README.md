# Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge

This is my code for Shopify's Front End Developer Intern Challenge. I completed it in 6 hours using tools and frameworks I am quite familiar with, namely the Vite, Vue, Vuetify stack. I also deployed the site over https using greenlock-express to automatically manage my ssl certificates. Finally I used pm2 to manage the process on the server the code is running on.

# Features

This site has a couple of unique features.
- I implemented in infinite scrolling behavior, wherein posts are seamlessly loaded in as you continue to scroll down
- Liked posts are cached using localstorage and can be viewed at anytime using the toggle in the top right hand corner
- Videos are embeded into the posts seamlessly
- In the top right hand corner there is also a theme toggle, allowing users to select between light and dark mode, and their choice is also saved locally on the machine
- The layout of the page is adaptive to the size of the browser (number of columns changes based on width)
- High res version of the image can be viewed by clicking on the image in the post
- Animations are use throughout the site for a better user experience
